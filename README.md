# Food-Trading-Sales-Prediction
A simple data science project analyzing sales data from a food trading company to predict total product sales using Linear Regression and store classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project involves data cleaning, modelling, and results evaluation. 

_**Problem Statement**_
Predicting total sales and store classification are important for understanding market trends and improving product placement. This project aims to:
- Predict the total sales of products sold in various stores.
- Classify which store a product was bought from, based on its features.

_**Dataset**_
The dataset includes 8524 sales records with 14 features from a food trading company
 
_**Project Workflow**_
1.	Data Preprocessing
Preparing the data for modeling through handling missing values, encoding features, and normalizing them. 

2.	Modeling
-	Predicting the ‘Total sales’ through linear regression
-	Predicting the “Store” through KNN classification algorithm

3.	Evaluating the results
Evaluating the results and performance of each algorithm considering the aim of using it. 

_**Tech Stack**_
- Python: The main programming language used
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- Numpy: For numerical operations
- Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation, and data preprocessing
- Google Colab: The main tool used for coding and experimentation

_**How to Use**_
1.	Food_Trading_Sales_Prediction.ipynb Notebook:
o	The Colab notebook contains the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
o	To run it, open the notebook in Google Colab:
- Click on the notebook file (Food_Trading_Sales_Prediction.ipynb).
- Choose "Open in Colab" from the GitHub file preview.
- You can run the cells sequentially to see the steps and results.

2.	Food Trading Sales Project Report:
- The report (Food Trading Sales Project Report.docx) includes: 
1- A comprehensive report explaining supervised vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification, and the data science life cycle.
2- The impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance was critically evaluated and compared.
- You can view or download the report directly from the repository to understand the project background and conclusions.
